# 🤖 Smart Task Assistant Guide

The Smart Task Assistant is an AI-powered voice and text interface that understands natural language for managing tasks efficiently. It features Apple-like smooth UX with confirmations and smart disambiguation.

## ✨ Features

### 🗣️ Natural Language Understanding

- **Full sentence recognition**: "Add a task: Submit my assignment before 5 PM tomorrow"
- **Conversational commands**: "Hey, remind me to call the client at 6 PM"
- **Context-aware parsing**: Automatically extracts priority, due dates, and tags

### 🎯 Smart Task Management

#### ➕ **Adding Tasks**

```
✅ "Add a task: Submit my assignment before 5 PM tomorrow"
✅ "Create a task: Buy groceries and call mom"
✅ "Hey Crow, remind me to call the client at 6 PM"
✅ "I need to review the quarterly report urgently"
```

#### ✔️ **Completing Tasks**

```
✅ "Mark the task 'Buy groceries' as done"
✅ "Complete Buy groceries"
✅ "Task 'Call mom' is complete"
✅ "Finish the report draft"
```

#### ❌ **Deleting Tasks (with Confirmation)**

```
✅ "Delete the task 'Cancel gym membership'"
✅ "Remove task 'Meeting with Arjun' from the list"
✅ "Cancel the Call dentist task"
```

#### 🔄 **Modifying Tasks**

```
✅ "Change task 'Buy groceries' to 'Buy groceries and fruits'"
✅ "Update 'Submit assignment' deadline to tomorrow 9 AM"
✅ "Edit task 'Prepare slides' and add 'Include team feedback'"
```

### 🧠 Smart Features

#### **Similarity Detection & Disambiguation**

When multiple tasks match your command:

```
User: "Delete the meeting task"
Assistant: "I found 2 tasks with 'meeting' in the title. Which one did you mean?"
1. Meeting with Arjun
2. Team meeting preparation

User: "The first one" or "Meeting with Arjun"
```

#### **Confirmation for Sensitive Actions**

Before deleting or modifying tasks:

```
Assistant: "Are you sure you want to delete 'Cancel gym membership'? Say 'yes' or 'no'."
User: "Yes"
Assistant: "Task deleted successfully. It's gone for good!"
```

#### **Fuzzy Task Matching**

- **Exact match**: "Buy groceries" → Finds "Buy groceries"
- **Partial match**: "groceries" → Finds "Buy groceries"
- **Word overlap**: "grocery shopping" → Finds "Buy groceries"

### 🎛️ Advanced Parsing

#### **Priority Detection**

- `urgent`, `asap`, `immediately`, `critical` → **Urgent**
- `important`, `high`, `priority` → **High**
- `low`, `later`, `someday` → **Low**
- Default → **Medium**

#### **Due Date Recognition**

- `today`, `tomorrow`, `tonight`
- `Monday`, `Tuesday`, etc.
- `before 5 PM`, `by tomorrow`
- `12/25`, `12-25`

#### **Auto-tagging**

- `call`, `phone`, `contact` → **call** tag
- `buy`, `purchase`, `shopping` → **shopping** tag
- `meeting`, `meet` → **meeting** tag
- `email`, `send`, `reply` → **email** tag
